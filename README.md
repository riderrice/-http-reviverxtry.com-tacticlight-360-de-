TacticLight 360 This worm develops in the soil, and hides there most of your time. But, when it comes out, it will devour great quantities of tomato plant leaves. Following 2nd night, my plant that were initially so robust and about 2 feet tall was nearly all eaten. I could not find him after the actual night, probably because he works mostly at night, and he has been so similar color currently being the plant. Got no idea he am voracious.
